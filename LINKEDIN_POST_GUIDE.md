🚀 Excited to share my latest project: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant!

I built an intelligent code review platform that automatically analyzes pull requests using machine learning and provides actionable feedback.

✨ Key Features:
• AI-powered analysis using GPT-4 and Claude for deep code understanding
• 24+ comprehensive rule-based checks (security, quality, performance)
• Real-time dashboard with interactive visualizations
• Smart deduplication and severity classification
• GitHub webhook integration for automated PR reviews
• Dark mode and fully responsive design

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Backend: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery
• Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite
• AI/ML: OpenAI API, Few-shot learning, Context-aware prompting
• DevOps: Docker, Render, Netlify, GitHub Actions

💡 What I learned:
• Integrating LLMs with production applications
• Building scalable async task queues
• Optimizing database queries with strategic indexing
• Creating intuitive UIs for complex data

🎯 Results:
• 90% reduction in database load through caching
• 5-10x faster queries with proper indexing
• Production-ready with error tracking and monitoring
